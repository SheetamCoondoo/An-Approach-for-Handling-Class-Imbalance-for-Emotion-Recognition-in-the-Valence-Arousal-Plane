Positive or bad feelings are associated with a mental state known as emotion. Its control is essential since it plays a significant part in both our personal and professional daily life. Emotion is difficult to define precisely, despite its importance. While negative emotions can cause major health prob-lems, positive emotions support health and energy. Emotions are complexly shaped by the interaction between psychological processes and physiological reactions. Research from many fields aims to quickly identify human emo-tions. Physiological signals and data science methods together present an in-teresting prospect for emotion identification.  
This work focuses on classifying four emotional states along the Valence-Arousal plane using Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) data. Standard sensors can be used to gather GSR signals non-invasively. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) techniques were used to create synthetic samples of the mi-nority class in order to address class imbalances. The dataset was then sub-jected to conventional supervised machine learning methods. Furthermore, a unique approach that uses physiological signal characteristics for emotion identification was presented. This method provides fresh perspectives on ef-ficiently comprehending and controlling emotions.
